# Space Mission Analysis 
### This jupyter notebook is an analysis of all space missions launched between the years of 1957 and 2020. This analysis was the final project in the 100 Days of Coding: Python course on Udemy. The data has been scraped from [NextSpaceFlight](nextspaceflight.com).   

## About the Analysis

I graduated from University with a Bachelors of Science in History and a minor in Biochemisty. It was an odd combination as most of my piers has a Bachelors of Arts and minors in more humanitarian based studies. I've always been fascinated in history, politics, and social studies, but also in Science, chemistry, and physics. I even subbed my language courses for calculus based physics. My favorite course I ever took was from Dr. Webb, "The History of Science." It was a broad topic to cover in one course but combined my two passions.

This analysis combines history and science. Currently it is a surface analysis with not enough conclusions asked, but more of an exploration of the data to satisfy my own curiosities. I fully plan on returning to the analysis in the future to find out more.

The analysis in the notebook does three things well:

- Explores the data and finds weaknesses
- Visualizes trends for impact
- Draws attention to a few key points

The weakness in the data is a certain column in particular: Price. Most of the data is either purposefully omitted by governments and organizations or was not reported. I tackle the difficulties of this in my report. 

My report visualizes most trends I could find for the sake of making them more obvious. It's easy to scan real numbers and not realize the impact or differences with no comparison. Most of my charts were made with that in mind: comparison. It's hard to understand what a large number of space missions are without seeing what a dip in missions is. 

Using those charts I can draw attention to the few points I'm able to make with this data.

## Future Plans 

This analysis seems surface level to me without enough conclusions. I would like to go more into the rise of private organizations launching more in the modern day than government ones. Scraping new data into the current year could really paint a better picture of that. 


## How to Utilize

Some of the charts don't automatically render on github preview. This is probably due to the 5 second timeout it has. If you wish to run the code yourself or alter it to make more conclusions, simply clone the repository and attach the cvs to notebook to play with the data. I used Google Collab to write the notebook, but feel free to play with it in other programs. It views well in VS Code ass well

If you come up with any changes you think are groundbreaking be sure to let me know!

## Credits

This data was note scraped by me. It was part of the 100 Days of Code challenge by Angela Yu. There is a large section on webscraping in that course, but this was done for us. The notebook code was written by me. As mentioned before the data comes from [NextSpaceFlight](nextspaceflight.com).
